# Asg-12
**a) Purpose of the Program(s):** The airport program aims to load the data from ‘Stations.csv’ and create a data structure that will map a 3-character Airport code to the airport's location, both its city and state.

The city's program aims to load the data from ‘CompleteData.csv’ and compute both the most popular departing cities, and the most popular arriving cities.

**b) Input:** The airport's program input is the file named "Stations.csv". The city's program input is a file named "CompleteData.csv" and the number of cities the user wants to know about.

**c) Expected Output:** The airport's program output is a data structure that will map a 3-character Airport code to the airport's location, both its city and state. The city's program output is the most popular departing cities, and the resulting number of cities as 2 separate tsv files, with a header including the city, the state, and the number of either flights going out of that city or flights going into the city.

**d) Type of Execution:** The type(s) of execution for the airport and city's program is sequential execution.

**e) Possible Improvements:** The airport program could be improved by: adding error handling and adding comments. 

The protein program could be improved by: finding a way to reduce data frame loading, adding error handling and user input validation, and adding comments.
